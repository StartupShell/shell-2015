          <p>As an independent program from the University of Maryland, we rely solely on donations to fund Startup Shell's operation. Your donation goes directly to providing the resources, space, and events needed for student-run companies to grow.</p>
          <p>Donations have helped people like Ari grow the creative community in DC with <a href="http://www.bgoti.com/" target="_blank">her company BGOTI</a> or helped Brett create the <a href="http://readybox.co/" target="_blank">fastest consumer 3D printer</a> on the market. These contributions create real impact for real students.</p>
          <p class="sub">Startup Shell is a non-profit organization pursuant to Section 501(c)(3) of the United States Internal Revenue Code. Your donation to Startup Shell may qualify for an income tax deduction in accordance with Federal and/or State income tax laws.
